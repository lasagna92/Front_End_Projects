    <p>
        I am a 30th years old Italian passionate professional that can't wait to start a new career in the IT world. 
        I came in London about 7 years ago after changing few jobs and roles I build a career in pastry without any professional experience, 
        just with lots of passion and dedication.
        I have always dreamed about a career in the Tech world and after the amazing opportunity of the HyperionDev software engineering bootcamp,
        I am totally committed to success through hard work, attention to detail and excellent creative problem-solving attitude.

    <p>
        The HyperionDev software engineering bootcamp taught me the abilities to build, maintain and run software and applications using one of the most requested programming language, Python.
        I created more than 30 programs with this language using framework such as Django and storing, manipulating and retrieving data with SQL.
        The performed tasks involve real life problem solving and the use of complex algorithms.
        I learned JavaScript, CSS and HTML as autodidact.
        I am keen to gain experience and new skills and learn more about software development and programming languages, Java and C++ are my priorities.

        I have more than ten year's experience in the hospitality, I have been covering multiple roles in different work environment. 
        During this period, I have gained an incredible attention to details and the essential ability to adapt as fast as possible to changes.
        My work experience required me to work under pressure, to be extremely attentive, committed. 
        I have experience in communication, customer service and management.
        I believe my skills, the wish to commence a new career and my various work experience in different areas,
        even though are not in the IT, would make me a valuable addition to a professional team.
